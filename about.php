    <div class='textbox-content'>
        I have been coding for as long as I can remember. I started with QBasic in elementary school and never really stopped.
        However, it wasn't until college that I really began to appreciate what I could accomplish through programming. I studied
        physics, despite going in knowing that I would probably end up as a developer anyway. I knew that I would be able to teach
        myself whatever I needed to know about computer science, and I wanted to learn something that I couldn't learn on my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        The most important thing that I learned in physics was how to approach problems. Physics encourages a bottom-up method of 
        problem-solving, starting with simple principles (like conservation of energy) and ending with complex solutions (like the 
        evolution of a chaotic system). This allowed me to develop a general 
        approach to solving problems:
        <ul>
            <li>What do I expect a solution to look like?</li>
            <li>What information do I need to craft that solution?</li>
            <li>How do I find that information?</li>
        </ul>
        While I ultimately decided physics wasn't for me, I carried on this approach as I learned computer science. By approaching
        problems this way, I learned much more quickly than I had before. I began to try to understand systems on a more fundamental
        level, rather than simply copying code from Stack Overflow and hoping that it worked. This allowed me to transform my idle 
        fascination with computer science into a genuine passion, not only for programming, but for learning as a whole.
        <br />
        <br />
        What I love most about programming is what I loved about physics - being able to understand and work with complex systems. I
        have found this joy in all kinds of coding that I've tried, from game development to robotics. I am currently a web developer
        professionally, and I am excited to continue to grow and learn new things.
        <br />

        I also love music, animals, and video games, in case you were wondering.
